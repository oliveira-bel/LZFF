a data frame with data file columns read and recoded as needed.

\description{
This is a simple function for reading, recoding, and performing some checks on a data file. This function does not recode pedigree data.
}
\details{
The rrcData function reads data from a file and stores it in a data frame.
Otherwise, it uses the data object provided by the user via the datObj argument. The first
action of the function recodes the environmental effects, or more generally, the effects
which were not indicated as being associated with pedigree, traits, or date. After that, it
It is then checked whether all characters in the data object are ASCII and whether the recoded values are all
positive, if the integers are less than or equal to 2,147,483,647, and if the variances are within
the interval 1E-5 to 1E5. Failure in any of these checks stops the function.

The first two checks aim to guarantee that common requirements for genetic evaluation
softwares are met. Checking whether the integer values are greater than the presented
value ensures that data can be processed by multiple systems. The final check aims
to prevent numerical problems in iterative processes, which are typically used in
genetic analyses.

# Creating data
data<-data.frame(id = paste0("i", 1:5), sire = paste0("s", c(rep(1, 2), rep(2, 2), 3)),
dam = paste0("d", 1:5), cg = gl(n = 2, k = 2, length = 5, labels = c("gc1", "gc2")),

trt1 = rnorm(5, 2, 2), trt2 = rnorm(5, 10, 3))
data

# Recoding and checking data
# All data must pass the checks and the cg colum must be recoded
rcData<-rrcData(datObj = data, colsPdg = 1:3, colsTrts = 6:7, colsDts = 5)
